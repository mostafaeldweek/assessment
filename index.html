            I had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us away
            from each other. My own complete happiness, and the home-centred
            interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself
            master of his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my
            attention, while Holmes, who loathed every form of society with his
            whole Bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings in Baker Street,
            buried among his old books, and alternating from week to week
            between cocaine and ambition, the drowsiness of the drug, and the
            fierce energy of his own keen nature. He was still, as ever, deeply
            attracted by the study of crime, and occupied his immense faculties
            and extraordinary powers of observation in following out those
            clues, and clearing up those mysteries which had been abandoned as
            hopeless by the official police. From time to time I heard some
            vague account of his doings: of his summons to Odessa in the case of
            the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of
            the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee, and finally of the mission
            which he had accomplished so delicately and successfully for the
            reigning family of Holland. Beyond these signs of his activity,
            however, which I merely shared with all the readers of the daily
            press, I knew little of my former friend and companion.

            One night--it was on the twentieth of March, 1888--I was returning
            from a journey to a patient (for I had now returned to civil
            practice), when my way led me through Baker Street. As I passed the
            well-remembered door, which must always be associated in my mind
            with my wooing, and with the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet,
            I was seized with a keen desire to see Holmes again, and to know how
            he was employing his extraordinary powers. His rooms were
            brilliantly lit, and, even as I looked up, I saw his tall, spare
            figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against the blind. He was
            pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his head sunk upon his chest
            and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who knew his every mood and
            habit, his attitude and manner told their own story. He was at work
            again. He had risen out of his drug-created dreams and was hot upon
            the scent of some new problem. I rang the bell and was shown up to
            the chamber which had formerly been in part my own.

            His manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I
            think, to see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye,
            he waved me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and
            indicated a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he stood
            before the fire and looked me over in his singular introspective
            fashion.
